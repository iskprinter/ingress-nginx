Infrastructure for IskPrinter

## Instructions

1. Deploy a Kubernetes cluster. The current Kubernetes cluster was set up manually, but if it ever needs to be recreated, then I will use Terraform.

1. Deploy an Nginx ingress controller. Refer to the instructions for your Cloud Provider on the [Installation Guide](https://kubernetes.github.io/ingress-nginx/deploy/#gce-gke).
